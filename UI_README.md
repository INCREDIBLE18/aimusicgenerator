## 🔧 Configuration

The UI automatically reads from `config.yaml` and allows you to modify settings through the web interface. Key settings include:

```yaml
data:
  midi_dir: "path/to/your/midi/files"
  sequence_length: 64  # Optimized for faster training
  
train:
  epochs: 10          # Reduced for faster training
  batch_size: 128     # Increased for efficiency
  
model:
  embedding_dim: 128  # Optimized dimensions
  rnn_units: 256      # Balanced complexity
```

## 🎵 Music Generation Tips

### Temperature Settings
- **0.5-0.8**: Conservative, stays close to training data
- **0.9-1.1**: Balanced creativity and coherence
- **1.2-1.5**: More creative and varied
- **1.6+**: Experimental and unpredictable

### Length Recommendations
- **50-100 notes**: Short phrases or motifs
- **200-400 notes**: Complete musical sections
- **500+ notes**: Full compositions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No trained models found"**
   - Complete data processing first
   - Train at least one model
   - Check the outputs directory

2. **"Data processing failed"**
   - Verify MIDI files are in the correct directory
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

3. **Slow training**
   - Reduce batch size in settings
   - Lower sequence length
   - Use smaller model dimensions

4. **Browser doesn't open automatically**
   - Manually navigate to http://localhost:8501
   - Check if port 8501 is available
   - Try a different port in the launch command

## 📈 Performance Optimization

The modern UI includes several optimizations:

- **Reduced Model Complexity**: Faster training with minimal quality loss
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Streamlined preprocessing pipeline
- **Smart Caching**: Reuse processed data when possible
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time feedback on all operations
